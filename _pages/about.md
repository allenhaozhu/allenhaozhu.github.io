Welcome! I am Dr. Hao (Allen) Zhu, a Postdoctoral Fellow at Data61, CSIRO Australia in Sydney. I specialize in AI for Science (AI4Sci), graph neural networks, and machine learning. I completed my Ph.D. at Australian National University, where I focused on advancing the field of graph machine learning.

## Current Position

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at Data61, CSIRO Australia's data science research institute, located in Sydney. My research focuses on AI for Science (AI4Sci), advancing graph neural networks, and developing novel machine learning algorithms for scientific applications and complex data structures.

## Background

I bring a unique combination of academic research expertise and industry leadership experience. Prior to my doctoral studies, I served as a senior technical manager at JD.com in China (2017-2019), where I led teams developing machine learning applications for financial services. Before that, I worked at 3M (2012-2017) focusing on face recognition and deep learning applications. These roles allowed me to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications.

## Education

- **Ph.D.** in Graph Machine Learning, Australian National University
- **M.S.** in Computer Science, Beijing Normal University (2012)
  - Specialized at the National Key Laboratory for Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning
- **B.S.** Harbin Institute of Technology (2008)

## Research Interests

My research spans multiple domains within artificial intelligence and machine learning:

- **AI for Science (AI4Sci)**: Applying machine learning to scientific discovery and research
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Developing novel architectures and algorithms for learning on graph-structured data
- **Protein Analysis**: Computational methods for protein fitness landscapes and design
- **Computer Vision**: Applications in facial recognition and visual pattern recognition
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Contrastive learning and representation learning methods
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Learning with limited data and transductive approaches

## Industry Experience

During my industry experience, I gained extensive expertise in:

**At JD.com (2017-2019):**
- Leading cross-functional teams in AI product development
- Implementing machine learning solutions at scale
- Financial technology applications

**At 3M (2012-2017):**
- Face recognition and deep learning applications
- Computer vision system development and optimization
- Research and development in industrial AI applications

I am passionate about advancing machine learning research while maintaining a strong connection to practical applications that can benefit society.
