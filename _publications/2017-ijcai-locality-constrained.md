## Abstract

Deep hashing methods have shown promising results for large-scale image retrieval by learning compact binary codes. However, most existing approaches focus on preserving global similarity while ignoring local neighborhood relationships, which are crucial for fine-grained image retrieval. In this paper, we propose Locality Constrained Deep Supervised Hashing (LCDSH), which incorporates local neighborhood constraints into the deep hashing framework. Our method ensures that images with similar local features are mapped to similar binary codes, preserving fine-grained visual similarities. We introduce a novel locality constraint that maintains the local manifold structure of the original feature space in the binary code space. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LCDSH achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art hashing methods, particularly for fine-grained image retrieval tasks.
