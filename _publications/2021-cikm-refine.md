## Abstract

Network embedding has become a fundamental technique for analyzing graph-structured data. However, most existing methods suffer from high computational complexity and poor scalability to large networks. In this paper, we propose REFINE (Random RangE FInder for Network Embedding), a novel approach that leverages random range finder techniques to efficiently compute network embeddings. Our method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining embedding quality. REFINE works by approximating the spectral decomposition of graph matrices using randomized algorithms, making it highly scalable to large networks. Extensive experiments on various network analysis tasks demonstrate that REFINE achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while being orders of magnitude faster.
