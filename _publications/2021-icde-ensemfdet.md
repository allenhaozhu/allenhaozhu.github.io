## Abstract

Fraud detection is a critical task in financial technology, where traditional machine learning approaches often fail to capture complex relationships between users and transactions. In this paper, we propose EnsemFDet, an ensemble approach to fraud detection that leverages bipartite graph representations of user-transaction relationships. Our method models the fraud detection problem as a graph-based learning task, where users and transactions form a bipartite graph, and fraudulent activities can be detected by analyzing graph patterns. EnsemFDet combines multiple graph neural network models in an ensemble framework to improve detection accuracy and robustness. We introduce novel graph features that capture both local and global patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior. The ensemble approach helps mitigate the impact of class imbalance and adversarial attacks common in fraud detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on real-world financial datasets demonstrate that EnsemFDet achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art fraud detection methods.
