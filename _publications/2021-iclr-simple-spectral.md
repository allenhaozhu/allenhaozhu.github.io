## Abstract

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph learning tasks. However, existing spectral methods often suffer from high computational complexity and limited expressiveness, while spatial methods may struggle with theoretical understanding. In this paper, we propose Simple Spectral Graph Convolution (S²GC), a method that bridges the gap between spatial and spectral approaches. Our method provides a simple yet theoretically grounded framework that achieves competitive performance with lower computational cost. S²GC leverages spectral graph theory to design efficient convolution operations while maintaining the simplicity of spatial methods. We provide theoretical analysis showing that our method can capture important graph properties and demonstrate its effectiveness on various node classification and graph classification tasks.
