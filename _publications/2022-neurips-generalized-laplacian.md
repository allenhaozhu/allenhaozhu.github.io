## Abstract

Laplacian Eigenmaps is a classical method for non-linear dimensionality reduction and graph-based semi-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose Generalized Laplacian Eigenmaps that unifies many existing graph embedding methods within a single framework. Our approach provides theoretical insights into the relationships between different graph embedding techniques and offers a principled way to design new methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various graph learning tasks and show improvements over existing methods.
