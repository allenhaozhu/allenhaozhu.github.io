## Abstract

Understanding protein fitness landscapes is crucial for protein engineering and evolutionary biology. Traditional approaches often rely on experimental measurements or computationally expensive simulations, limiting their applicability to large-scale protein design problems. In this paper, we propose a novel computational framework that applies spectral graph theory to analyze protein fitness landscapes. We model proteins as graphs where amino acids are nodes and their interactions define edges, then use spectral properties to characterize fitness landscapes. Our approach reveals fundamental principles governing protein evolution and provides efficient methods for predicting protein fitness. We introduce spectral descriptors that capture both local and global structural properties relevant to protein function. These descriptors enable rapid screening of protein variants and identification of evolutionary pathways. We demonstrate that spectral graph properties are strongly correlated with experimental fitness measurements across diverse protein families. Our method provides new insights into the relationship between protein structure, dynamics, and function, offering a principled approach to computational protein design.
